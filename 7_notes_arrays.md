zyBooks Ch 5 Arrays 5.1 - 5.4

An array is a named collection of data items, where each item can be directly access with an index.
The general syntax for declaring an array is:

```
type[] name = {value, value, â€¦ value};
```

Or

```
type[] name = new type[numElements];
```

Example with array of integers:

```
int[] testScores = {100, 95, 75, 100, 82};
```


Java arrays are objects. Their elements can be accessed with a zero based index.

The length of an array can be determined with the use of the ```length``` property and can be used in conjunction with a loop to iterate over the entire array.
