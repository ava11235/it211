zyBooks Ch 7 Objects and Classes

A class in Java has two meanings: It can refer to a program, Â or it can refer to a blueprint for instantiating new objects.
For example, an Employee class is a blueprint for employees. 

An object is an entity with state (knows things) and behaviors (does things).
For example, Amy Smith is an instance of an Employee class. Amy has a state (name, SSN, job title) and behaviors (submit reports, get paid, etc.)

Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to programs where objects interact with other objects.
Abstraction is the notion that you don't need to understand the inner details of how something works in order to understand its external behavior. 
For example, everything is made up of subatomic particles, but you don't need to understand how they work in order to be able to make breakfast.
